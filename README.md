Github is an open source version control system created by Linus Torvalds. 
Github allows for something called Version control. This is the use of a system to keep track of changes to source code or other documents.
Github also allows the ability for multiple people to work on the same document at the same time creating flexibility and versitility to the program.

How to create a repository:
Step 1: Click the + sign in the upper right corner.
Step 2: Choose “Create New repository”.

How to import a repository: 
Step1: From the Main page Select Checkout from version control Git OR from within Webstorm Select VCS. 
Enter Github repository name. 
Enter local path name.

Creating a webstorm file:
Choose File , HTML, HTML 5 or File, Stylesheet.
Add a file: The Add to Git dialog opens. Click Add. This adds to local file system.
Commit/save changes.
Push the change: Click “Ctrl, Shift,  K” Or “VCS, Git, Push”.
And now your file is on github!

Lastly, choose your github page location:
Select “Master branch”.
Note the published URL. 

**Branch**: The branch into which changes are combined when you merge a pull request. When you create a pull request, you can change the base branch from the repository's default branch to another branch if required.# Clone

**Commit**: A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the "SHA" or "hash") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes commited along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.

**Fetch**: When you use git fetch, you're adding changes from the remote repository to your local working branch without committing them. Unlike git pull, fetching allows you to review changes before committing them to your local branch.

**GIT**: Git is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.

**Github**: GitHub Apps provide a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function. They can be installed directly on organizations and user accounts and granted access to specific repositories. They come with granular permissions and built-in webhooks.

**Merge**: Merging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a "pull request" (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done through a pull request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line.

**Merge Conflict**: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file. The merge conflict must be resolved before you can merge the branches.

**Push**: To push means to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you can push those changes so that others may access them.

**Pull**: Pull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. See also fetch.

**Remote**: This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

**Repository**: A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
